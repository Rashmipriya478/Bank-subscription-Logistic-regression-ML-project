# Bank-subscription-Logistic-regression-ML-project




1. Problem Definition
Objective: The goal is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features like age, job, marital status, etc.
Data Source: The dataset likely contains records of customer interactions with a bank, including features such as age, job type, marital status, education, balance, and previous marketing campaign outcomes.

3. Data Collection and Preparation
Data Import: Load the dataset into your working environment (e.g., Python using Pandas).
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that may help in improving the model, such as binning age groups or encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.

Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and test sets, usually with an 80-20 or 70-30 ratio.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other statistics to understand the data distribution.
Visualization: Use plots (histograms, bar charts, box plots, correlation matrices) to visualize relationships between features and the target variable.
Correlation Analysis: Determine how features correlate with each other and the target variable. High correlation might indicate multicollinearity, which needs to be addressed.

6. Model Selection
Logistic Regression: Choose logistic regression as it is suitable for binary classification problems.
Model Assumptions: Verify assumptions like no multicollinearity, a linear relationship between the logit of the outcome and the independent variables, and that observations are independent.

8. Model Training
Model Fitting: Train the logistic regression model on the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters like the regularization strength to improve model performance using techniques such as cross-validation.

10. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve to evaluate the model.
Confusion Matrix: Create a confusion matrix to visualize the performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Model Interpretation: Interpret the coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on the probability of subscription.

12. Model Optimization
Feature Selection: Use techniques like backward elimination, forward selection, or Lasso regression to select the most important features.
Regularization: Apply L1 or L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.
Resampling Techniques: If the data is imbalanced, consider techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or adjusting the decision threshold.

14. Final Model and Predictions
Final Model Selection: Choose the model with the best trade-off between bias and variance.
Test Set Evaluation: Evaluate the final model on the test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Predictions: Generate predictions for new data or the test set.
